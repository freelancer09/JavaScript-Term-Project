The Game:
- Objective: To reach the closest score to 21 without going over.

- Gameplay: Each round the dealer and the player are dealt two cards from a standard 52 card deck. One of the dealer's cards is hidden from the player. 
During their turn, the player may choose to 'Hit'. They are dealt an additional card. They may repeat this process any number of times. If the player's
total hand score exceeds 21, they 'bust' and automatically lose the round. They may stop drawing additional cards at any time by choosing to 'Stand'. This
passes play to the dealer. The dealer then draws cards if their total hand score is under 17. If the dealer exceeds 21, they 'bust' and the player wins.
Once both players are done drawing cards, all cards are revealed the highest hand score total wins!

- Scoring: Numbered cards are worth the value shown. A Jack, Queen or King are worth 10 points. An Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points.

Current issues:
- The card images I use were found on pixabay.com. The set I am using are not completely uniform. Some of the cards have little graphical flurishes.

Planned fixes:
- I plan to either edit the images I current have or to find a new set of images.

Future plans:
- Add site-wide chip count for placing bets.
