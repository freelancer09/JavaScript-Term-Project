This website is intended to appeal to fans of physical casinos looking for a virtual alternative.
The layout was created to be simple and easy to navigate while the color scheme was chosen to mimic choices commonly made in casios.
Three games are playable: Blackjack, Texas Hold 'em, and slots.

The Game
- Objective: To match two or more icons.

- Gameplay: Each round the player presses the SPIN button to randomize the icons.

Current issues:
- The icon images are inconsistent on size, leading to stretching.

Planned fixes:
- I plan to find a different icon image set to make them more uniform.

Future plans:
- Add site-wide chip count for placing bets.
