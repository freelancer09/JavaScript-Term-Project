The Game:
- Objective: To achieve the highest scoring hand among all players.

- Gameplay: Each player is dealt two cards only they can see. The dealer reveals five community cards
in the center of the table. Each player constructs a five card hand out of these seven cards to
achieve the highest possible ranking hand.

1) Straight Flush (five sequential cards of the same suit)
2) Four of a kind
3) Full house (one pair and one three of a kind)
4) Flush (five cards of the same suit)
5) Straight (five sequential cards)

Current issues:
- The card images I use were found on pixabay.com. The set I am using are not completely uniform. Some of the cards have little graphical flurishes.

Planned fixes:
- I plan to either edit the images I current have or to find a new set of images.

Future plans:
- Add site-wide chip count for placing bets.
